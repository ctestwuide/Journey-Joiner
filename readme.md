# Journey Joiner

Journey Joiner is a web application designed to help individuals find travel buddies. Users create a profile, which includes a picture, a bio, and their travel interests. They can then browse through other profiles in an effort to find a "match" or travel companion. 

The target audience is individuals who have a desire to travel, but do not wish to do it alone. This app provides an easy way to connect with like-minded travelers and make new travel companions.

## Key Features

The main feature of Journey Joiner is its ability to help users find other travel partners by creating and customizing their own profiles. Users can swipe through other profiles and match with users who share similar travel interests.

## Technologies

This app was built using React for the front-end and Django for the back-end.

## Developer

Journey Joiner was developed by Chase Testwuide, a graduate student studying software development at the University of Glasgow. This project was created as part of Chase's masters dissertation and will continue to be developed for his portfolio.

## Project Status

Journey Joiner is currently in the development stage. There are plans to add several new features, including a direct messaging system, notifications, and enhanced security measures. Please note that it is not currently ready for production due to potential security issues.
